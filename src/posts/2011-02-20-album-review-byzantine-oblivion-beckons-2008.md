Byza-who-the-fuck?

  

Byzantine mother fucker, do you speak it... no wait that's wrong, the Byzantines spoke fucking Latin or Greek.

  

Anyway, point and case is fucking Byzantine is awesome but underrated as fuck and I'll never understand why. Just hear at this [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULB6uoddl-U) from their album Oblivion Beckons and tell me it ain't fucking awesome, yeah you take that and shove it down your pipe mister because you know this is awesome.

  

Go check the rest on their MySpace site, or is it My\_\_\_\_\_\_ now?

  

And for the love of whatever you like buy them something, they need it to record more fucking awesome music or well maybe not but damn it give them money.
