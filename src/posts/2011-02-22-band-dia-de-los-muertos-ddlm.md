No, I'm not talking about these guys.

_Looking for a Vocalist, inquiries down in hell_

I recall hearing them a couple of years ago and buying their original Mini-CD/Album/EP/Whatever and I liked what I was hearing. Alfonso Pizon on drums is solid as fuck, Andres Jaramillo and Adrian Villanueva play some mean chunky guitars that could cut you in half and with a huge repertory of guest vocalists, which include Tony Campos AKA Maldito X (Static-X, Asesino, Possessed) and recently Jeff Walker (Carcass), so it is no surprise that this band is building some quality material right now as we speak.

  

The band is releasing a new album called _Satanico Dramatico_ which should be hitting stores by March 23 so in the meantime while we wait for that to happen why don't you check out their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/DDLMband) or [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/quevivanlosmuertos) and follow them/befriend them/etc.

  

Enjoy!
