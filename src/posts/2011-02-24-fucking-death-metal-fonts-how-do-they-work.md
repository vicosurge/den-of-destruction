Ok, seriously this gets a little out of hand sometimes in Death and Black Metal.

_Fucking Brutal or is it "Br00tal"? How about fucking unreadable!_

Yes, some of these are still readable but it has reached a point where even Metal Sucks has made a contest out of fucking completely unreadable band logos that no human being in their existence could ever decipher unless they know fucking hieroglyphs or understand a lot about symbology... seriously what the flying fuck goes on here?

  

Just dropping my two cents here people. If I like a band, the sound, the energy, the lyrics or whatever is it that caught my attention I need to know its fucking name so I can actually go around and say "Hey X or Y band is awesome, go check 'em out" instead of, "Well fuck I heard this band the other day but between the unholy growls and the unreadable logo I never caught their name".

  

And I'm being honest here dudes and dudettes, if you're playing I'm sure you're having a good time but I'm also sure, 90% sure, that you're doing this for the money and if that's the case think about it, take off your Brutal Hardhat by the way, and you'll see a little bit of logic in it.
