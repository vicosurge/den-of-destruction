I am not exactly sure how to describe this but a band whose name is Circus Maximus makes me think of something really fucking bloody and deadly like a true Circus Maximus, fucking Nascar of the Roman Era.

_Like Nascar only with chariots and more crashes_

So it suddenly comes to my attention that there is a band with said name but even though it follows the standard _theme per say_ it is not as violent as... [Ex Deo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcfaltp8CL0) for example which goes balls deep on putting a good representation/show of the Roman Empire in their videos and lyrics.

  

Now Circus Maximus as I mentioned I don't personally feel it drops into this category but regardless of that it is awesome... awesome in the sense that it is progressive in many ways but I'll let you again be the judge of that by this [11 minute masterpiece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcHX-14rOhk).
