Ok, no one told me that there was going to be [this](https://secure.scion.com/scion/ssl/rsvp/scionRockFestTickets.do) at Pomona.

  

First, I'm flipping because NO ONE FUCKING TOLD ME, well Gil did but that's besides the point, and this is fucking SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET.

  

Second, the fucking thing is free, FREE DAMN IT FREE.

  

Third, there are, no, more, fucking, TICKETS.
