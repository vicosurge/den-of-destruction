Well it seems that getting kindly back-linked by [K. Mandla](http://kmandla.wordpress.com/) has brought in a heavy influx of users into this blog, heavy goes something like... 100 to 200 visitors?

  

Ironically this blog has not much to do with technology... yeah I wouldn't consider Metal of any brand to be technologically savvy, well maybe that's just me since you know there's bands like [Blood Stain Child](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oi-8xl7uZs) and [Fear Factory](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ryA583mO40) with their almost morbid obsession with Terminator.

  

Ok I think I'm actually being an ass about the subject but hey nevermind me, I'm just some dude writting a blog.

  

On the other hand I may start a techie blog and add some random stories and ways to fix stuff that I learned while I worked at a Medical Disposables Factory... those were REALLY fun times.

  

And as a final side note I'll be adding more concerts for the nearby area as soon as possible.

  

Take care ya'll!
