Yesterday I was at Bonded by Blood, which I'll review later on today, and was speaking with the bass player who's name was Ben Bennetts (Thanks Wikipedia for confirming this)

Point and case being, he's got his own band project going along which is called "Smog" and he me that it was a sort of Black/Grunge band which at first struck me as funny and interesting. So today I'm listening to the band and I'm quite fascinated by it and let me point out that this is a one man band so this makes it all the way better even though it's not studio quality it is quite decent.

And well, since the guy said no one was paying for the demo and he was giving it away, I'll just post this here and let you [download](http://www.mediafire.com/file/tcwt64vp3m3suva/Smog.rar) it!
